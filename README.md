Project Name: FurEver Friends - Pet Adoption and Care Recommendation API


Project Description:

This RESTful API aims to find homes for pets without owners and help people find pets they
want to adopt. The API will provide a list of pets available for adoption, including information
about their gender, age, photos, the city they live in, and sterilization status. It will allow users to
adopt pets, search for nearby veterinarians, and receive tips for caring for their pets based on the
type of animal they have like dogs, cats, etc. Additionally, users can report stray animals they
have seen to facilitate their adoption. To enhance the reliability of these processes, a user rating
system will be implemented.
